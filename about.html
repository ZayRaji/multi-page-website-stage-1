                    <p>
                        Hello there! I am Zainab Raji. I am a Frontend Developer on a journey toward becoming a Fullstack Developer. 
                        My mission is to create inclusive and accessible systems, one line of code at a time. I believe that technology should 
                        be available to everyone, regardless of their abilities or the devices they use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading tech articles, teaching others what I have learned, or writing articles. I'm constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills, and I love sharing that journey with others 
                        in the developer community.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dear Future Zainab,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember this moment. Remember the excitement you feel right now, the nervousness about learning new technologies, 
                        and this zeal to succeed. You are at the beginning of an incredible journey, and while it might seem challenging now, trust that every obstacle you overcome will make you stronger and more capable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Each bug you fix, each error message you decode, and each feature you successfully implement is a step forward. Celebrate your small wins along the way, and DO NOT compare your progress to others. Everyone's journey is unique, and yours is exactly as it should be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep that curious mindset that brought you here. Stay humble, never stop learning, and always remember that even 
                        the most experienced developers were once beginners. The tech world will continue to evolve, and your ability to 
                        adapt and grow will be your greatest asset.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most importantly, remember why you started this journey. You want to create inclusive, accessible systems that make a 
                        difference in people's lives. Let that purpose guide you through the difficult moments, and never lose sight of 
                        the positive impact you can have through your code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You've got this! Keep coding, keep learning, and keep pushing forward. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>
                        This program represents more than just learning to code. This is about transforming my career and opening doors 
                        to opportunities I have worked hard to achieve. Grateful for this chance to learn from experienced mentors and 
                        to be part of a community of like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology and accessibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm about learning different things in this program. Creating websites 
                        that everyone can use, regardless of their abilities, aligns perfectly with my values. I want to be part of making 
                        the web a more inclusive space where everyone has equal access to information and opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Looking ahead, I see myself not just as a developer, but as someone who contributes to projects that matter, 
                        mentors others who are starting their coding journey, and continuously pushes myself to learn and grow. I would also like to be an HNG mentor one day. I want 
                        to be the kind of developer who writes code that's not only functional but also accessible, maintainable, and 
                        thoughtfully designed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is just the beginning of my fullstack journey, and I'm ready to embrace all the challenges and opportunities 
                        that come with it. Let's build something amazing!
